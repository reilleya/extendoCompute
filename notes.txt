Command syntax:
	["run"] -> ["run"]
	
newInput command argument formats:
	[1-5, 10, 12, 15, "cat", "dog"] -> [1,2,3,4,5,10,12,15,"cat","dog"]
	1 -> 1
	dog -> "dog"
	"range(0,110)" -> exec "values = "+"range(0,110)"


TODO:
	Tell clients what thread they belong to(*) so they can reconnect to the same thread rather than starting a new one
		Have connectionThreads stick around until closed after a socket disconnects, or at least for a reasonable delay
	Lib system/command
		Send blocks of code containing function/class definitions for clients to execute upon receiving, to set up the
			prerequisites for running the actual program
		How to handle imports?
			Simple case:
	Test command:
		Run the program on all clients with a single set of inputs and return/log stats
		Stats:
			Execution successful/error text
			Output
			Completion time for every client
	
	Send current program to new clients connecting so they can receive tasks properly(*)
	
	(*)Handshake packet:
		Sent upon accepting a new connection after receiving their initial communication.
		Recv:
			Connection Number: #, or -1 if new
			
		If new:
			Send:
				A new connection number
				Libraries, if they exist
		If existing:
			Figure out if the client's program is up to date and restart existing batch if it hasn't been reassigned

	Upon client disconnect, compare the results to the batch and revise it to only include unfinished tasks
	Make a shared, enumerated list of tasks
	Clean up *errors.txt upon successul exit, or if empty?
	
	
	Post processing? (like to save results to an image) ->
	Pipelines! No... scripts
		Scripts that can be run at any time
		Can be set to be automatically run after all results are in, 
			after each batch is finished, 
			after tasks are generated to make batches, 
			or at the start of execution to generate the tasks themselves.


		Access to internal structures
			Tasks
			Batches
			Inputs
			Results

		Uses:
			Generating tasks for a new execution
			Saving results in a very specific way when it is useful to save in a format other than the original python datastructure
			
		Command:
			addScript <name> <file>
				Loads the script in <file> and stores it under <name>
			
			delScript <name>
			
			addTrigger <name> <trigger>
				Sets the script <name> to be triggered by the event <trigger>
				Option for triggers:
					batching
					batchCompletion
					completion

			delTriggers <name>
				Removes all triggers from the script <name>
